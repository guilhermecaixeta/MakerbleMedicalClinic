# Makerble Medical Clinic

It's a web application built in rails 7 with Turbo and Stimulus, using as admin template [core-ui](https://coreui.io/bootstrap/docs/getting-started/introduction/) and [core-ui admin template](https://coreui.io/bootstrap/docs/templates/admin-dashboard/) and importmap as js package manager.

This application has the focus to be part of my personnal portfolio, but feel free to copy it or fork.
